SDSHNet:Dynamic Feature Fusion with Transformer and Star Operation for Efficient Detection in Aluminum Alloys Microscopic Inclusion

This work presents a lightweight detection framework that combines a Transformer encoder with StarNet as the main feature extractor. StarNet relies on star shaped sparse attention and depth wise large kernel convolutions to reduce parameter count and computation load while maintaining expressive features. A dynamic feature fusion module is designed to adaptively enhance feature representation in key regions, significantly improving the detection capability for tiny, low-contrast inclusions.
